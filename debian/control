Description: Graphical tool to repair boot problems
 In some situation, you might loose access to one or several of
 your operating systems, because of a buggy update, a bootloader
 problem, or after installing a new OS (e.g. installing
 Windows breaks Linux bootloader).
 .
 Boot-Repair is a graphical tool that will repair these problems,
 generally by reinstalling GRUB, which then restores access to the
 operating systems you had installed before the issue.
 .
 Boot-Repair also has advanced options to reinstall GRUB, add
 kernel options, or restore a generic MBR.
