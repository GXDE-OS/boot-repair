Description: Graphical tool to repair boot problems
 In some situation, you might loose access to one or several of
 your operating systems, because of a buggy update, a bootloader
 problem, a broken filesystem, or after installing a new OS (e.g.
 installing Windows breaks Linux bootloader).
 .
 Boot-Repair is a graphical tool that will repair these problems,
 generally by reinstalling GRUB, which then restores access to the
 operating systems you had installed before the issue.
 .
 Boot-Repair also has advanced options for reinstalling GRUB, adding
 kernel options, restoring a generic MBR, or repair a broken filesystem.
 It can also restore the original bootsector if it has been saved
 previously by Clean-Ubiquity.

Description: Operating System Uninstaller
 When you have several operating systems (Windows, MacOS, GNU/Linux ..)
 installed on your computer, you may want to remove one of them.
 .
 OS-Uninstaller is a graphical tool that will let you choose the system
 you want to remove, and uninstall it very easily. After your
 confirmation, it will format the selected system, and update the
 bootloader so that you will still access your other remaining systems.
 .
 OS-Uninstaller also has advanced options for OS formatting, and
 bootloader updating. It can also restore the original bootsector if it
 has been saved previously by Clean-Ubiquity.

Description: Make the Ubiquity installer safer
 Clean-Ubiquity is an addon for Ubiquity. It automatically performs
 a backup of the bootsector that is altered by Ubiquity, and links it
 with the UUID of the new OS.
 .
 This can be extremely useful if the computer is MBR-locked. MBR-lock is
 a system that can be found on some OEM computers with pre-installed
 Windows. It is (was?) put in place by some manufacturers in order to
 fight against Windows piracy, by preventing or making difficult the use
 of a Windows with a different version from the one that was originally
 on the computer. MBR-lock is now forbidden in some countries (e.g.
 France), so it should not be on recent computers. Basically, this
 system uses data written on the motherboard and/or the MBR. If the MBR
 has been altered (e.g. by GRUB), this system will detect it and prevent
 Windows (or the entire computer) to boot.
 .
 Clean-Ubiquity needs 2 preseeds integrated during the ISO building.
