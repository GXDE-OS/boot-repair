.TH CLEANUBIQUITYAFTER 8 "January 2012"
.SH NAME
cleanubiquityafter \- Second executable of Clean-Ubiquity
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B cleanubiquityafter
.SH DESCRIPTION
Clean-Ubiquity is an addon for Ubiquity. It automatically performs
a backup of the bootsector that is altered by Ubiquity, and links it
with the UUID of the new OS.
.br
This can be extremely useful if the computer is MBR-locked. MBR-lock is
a system that can be found on some OEM computers with pre-installed
Windows. It is (was?) put in place by some manufacturers in order to
fight against Windows piracy, by preventing or making difficult the use
of a Windows with a different version from the one that was originally
on the computer. MBR-lock is now forbidden in some countries (e.g.
France), so it should not be on recent computers. Basically, this
system uses data written on the motherboard and/or the MBR. If the MBR
has been altered (e.g. by GRUB), this system will detect it and prevent
Windows (or the entire computer) to boot.
.br
Clean-Ubiquity needs 2 preseeds integrated during the ISO building.
.br
cleanubiquityafter is the second and last executable of Clean-Ubiquity.
It is called by a preseed after the new Linux installation is finished.
It backups the bootsector of the disk that was altered by the installation.
It also links the backup to the UUID of the partition.
