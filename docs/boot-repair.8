.TH BOOT-REPAIR 8 "January 2012"
.SH NAME
Boot-Repair \- Graphical tool to repair boot problems
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B boot-repair
.SH DESCRIPTION
In some situation, you might loose access to one or several of
your operating systems, because of a buggy update, a bootloader
problem, a broken filesystem, or after installing a new OS (e.g.
installing Windows breaks Linux bootloader).
.br
Boot-Repair is a graphical tool that will repair these problems,
generally by reinstalling GRUB, which then restores access to the
operating systems you had installed before the issue.
.br
Boot-Repair also has advanced options for reinstalling GRUB, adding
kernel options, restoring a generic MBR, or repair a broken filesystem.
It can also restore the original bootsector if it has been saved
previously by Clean-Ubiquity.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
No command line options.
